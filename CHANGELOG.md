## unreleased

### Changed

* Depend on `libusb-sys` crate rather than directly linking to libusb ourselves.
* Generate bindings using `bindgen` at compile time, rather than checked into
  repo. This also added use of the bindgen option `constified_enum_module` which
  changes the API of the bindings slightly.

## [0.1.0] - 2017-04-14

### Added

* Initial release
